# CalTracker Client

This application allows the logged in user to view, update, and delete workouts that he/she owns. The user is able to see all of their workouts they have done and can keep track of their workout log. The user can add various information about their workout including the category, targeted body area, time spent in minutes, calories burned and the date of the workout. When a user creates a workout he/she can make edits to update that particular workout entry and can also delete any workouts if need be.

## Planning Story

Initially, what I wanted to do was to have a user add workouts and meals. For each day I Wanted to display to the user if they were at a calorie deficit or surplus. My project idea is a calorie tracker. I wanted to track the amount of calories burned and amount of calories consumed and compare the two to determine if a person was at a calorie deficit or calorie surplus for the day. I came up with this because I love fitness and I have an apple watch that tracks all of my calories burned throughout the day, but it doesn't compare the calories that I have consumed, and I think it is helpful to know if you are at a calorie surplus or deficit. People who have fitness goals like, gaining weight or losing weight would use it, and also those trying to maintain their current weight would use it.
